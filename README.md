## Introduction

Traditional encryption relies on secret keys stored or transmitted as strings. **GradientKey Encryption** innovates by embedding cryptographic keys into images ‚Äî specifically, gradients made up of multiple colors ‚Äî turning a key into a visual artifact. This blends cryptography with steganography and creative data encoding.

Use it to:

- Hide keys in images that look like normal colorful gradients  
- Generate complex keys tied to user passwords and image content  
- Encrypt and decrypt text securely with AES-256 underpinned by visual keys

## Concept & Design

- **Gradient Image as Key Container**:  
  A horizontally blended color gradient image contains multiple hidden salts and a 32-bit binary key encoded in pixel color channels.

- **Salts & Obfuscation**:  
  Multiple salts are embedded in separate horizontal bars in the image. The exact salt used is derived from a hash of the image size, colors count, and password, thwarting simple extraction.

- **Key Derivation**:  
  Using PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256 and the selected salt, a key hash seeds the gradient‚Äôs colors and the key binary embedding positions ‚Äî binding the key tightly to both image and password.

- **AES Encryption**:  
  The extracted key binary is converted into an AES-256 key (SHA256 of numeric key). AES-CBC mode with random IV and PKCS7 padding encrypts/decrypts messages.

## How It Works

### Key Generation  
1. Password + random salts ‚Üí PBKDF2 hash ‚Üí Seed hash  
2. Generate 10 gradient colors based on seed hash  
3. Create gradient image (800x100 px)  
4. Embed salts as bits in top horizontal bars  
5. Embed 32-bit binary key pseudo-randomly across pixels  
6. Save gradient image (`gradient_output.png`)  

### Encryption  
1. Load gradient image + password  
2. Extract salts, select correct salt by hashed parameters  
3. Derive seed hash from password + selected salt  
4. Extract binary key from pixels  
5. Derive AES key from binary key  
6. Generate random IV, encrypt plaintext using AES-CBC with PKCS7  
7. Save encrypted file (`encrypted_message.bin`) as [IV + ciphertext]  

### Decryption  
- Reverse the encryption process: extract AES key from gradient image + password, then decrypt the encrypted file.

## Security Considerations

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is a **proof-of-concept** and should not be used for critical production data without thorough security review.

- The strength depends heavily on the password and securely keeping the gradient image.  
- Salts and random embedding make key extraction hard but not impossible with advanced analysis.  
- The 32-bit embedded key binary might be brute forced with enough computing power ‚Äî consider expanding or varying size.  
- AES key derivation uses PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations ‚Äî secure but adjustable for your needs.
